# Achievements

Dragon's Money Laundering is supplied with a set of achievements to make the gaming experience even more engaging. They are difficult in nature but enable bragging rights for whomever manages to unlock them.

Besides personal satisfaction the Achievements have another key functionality. They teach new players the intricacies of using Character Ultimate Powers efficiently and in creative ways, thus enabling the players to play the game how the Core Developer Team intended it to be played.
