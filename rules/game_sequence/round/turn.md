3. If any Active or Passive Player plays a Character Ultimate Power or an Emblem in to the Resolution Stack, each other Player will have a chance on their respective turn to respond by playing any number of other Emblems or Character Ultimate Powers in to the Resolution Stack. Repeat this process until no Player plays a new Emblem and/or Character Power.
4. Resolve Resolution Stack as defined by Character Power/Emblem Resolution rule.

####### Character Power/Emblem Resolution rule

Character Ultimate Powers and Emblems are placed in a last-in-first-out stack called the Resolution Stack. Each subsequently played Emblem or Character Ultimate Power is placed on top of the stack, and after all Emblems and Character Ultimate Powers are played, the cards are resolved from the top to the bottom of the Resolution Stack.

###### Market Sequence

1. Active Player chooses any number of Resources from any one Stock in the Market Place.
2. Initiate Acquisition Attempt Sequence

####### Acquisition Attempt Sequence

The Target Value of an Acquisition Attempt is the combined face values of the Resources/Emblems selected by the Active Player. The Active Player has to roll equal to or more than the Target Value in order to obtain the desired Resources with the exception of 'Woot! Woot!' succeeding and 'Wyvern Eyes' failing automatically regardless of the Target Value. However, the Active Player and Passive Players have a chance to add negative and/or positive modifiers to the Target Value.

1. The Active Player may bid any number of Primary Buying Resources from his/her Treasury to aid his/her chances to acquire the desired set of Resources, or to proceed with the Acquisition Attempt without modifying the Target Value
  * All Passive Players have a chance to declare a Seize Attempt against Active Player's Acquisition Attempt
    * If there are more than one Passive Player willing to declare a Seize Attempt, the Passive Player that wins a Face-to-Face Card-Off gets awarded the Seize Attempt to the current Acquisition Attempt
2. If the Active Player bid any Primary Buying Resources the Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt is decreased by the face values of the bid Resources. If not, the Target Value for the Acquisition Roll stays the same.
3. If a Passive Player has been awarded the Seize Attempt the Resources the Passive Player has bid increase the Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt by the face values of the particular Resources.
  * The Active Player has a chance to respond to any Seize Attempt bid by bidding more Primary Buying Resources or try to cancel out the Passive Player's Primary Buying Resources as defined by Counter-Bidding rule.
  * Similarly the Passive Player has a chance to bid more Primary Buying Resources in response to Active Player's bids
  * Bidding is repeated until no Player bids in response to another player's bid.
  * All modifiers are applied to the Target Value from the bid Resources.
4. The Active Player performs an Acquisition Roll against the Target Value
  * If the Active Player succeeds, the Active Player may put the set of Resources involved in the Acquisition Attempt in to the Active Player's Treasury
  * If the Active Player fails, the Passive Player may put the set of Resources involved in the Acquisition Attempt in to the Passive Player's Treasury
5. All bid Resources are put to the Market Place

###### Black Market Sequence

The default Target Value of any Black Market is 7.

1. The Active Player chooses a Black Market
2. The Active Player may choose to declare a modifier no greater than the number of cards in the Active Player's Treasury
3. The Active Player rolls 2D6 against the Black Market Target Value
  * If the Active Player succeeds, the Active Player may take one card at random from the chosen Black Market. If the Active Player declared a modifier, the Active Player has to put that many cards of his/her choice in to the Black Market excluding the card the Active Player was awarded from that Black Market
  * If the Active Player fails, the Active Player is awarded no card and has to put cards equal to the declared modifier number at random from his/her Treasury in to the chosen Black Market
