## Global Events

### Global Event Types

#### ðŸ‚²-ðŸ‚¹ Decadence

Players can't play Character Ultimate Powers. However, if the number of cards in Player's Treasury is less than the face value of the Active Global Event card, the Player may choose to ignore this effect.

Resources that have a face value more than or equal to the face value of the Active Global Event card can't be bid on any Acquisition Attempts or Seize Attempts.

#### ðŸƒ‚-ðŸƒ‰ Tax Relief

If the number of cards in Player's Treasury is less than the face value of the Global Event card, the Player receives an extra Market Phase during his/her turn.

All Resources in the Market Place with face value of more than or equal to the Global Event card receive a -2 modifier to their Target Value until the end of Round.

#### ðŸ‚¢-ðŸ‚© Contraband Crackdown

Players can't make any Seize Attempts. However, if the number of cards in Player's Treasury is less than the face value of the Active Global Event card, the Player may choose to ignore this effect.

Each bid Resource that has a face value equal to or more than the Active Global Event card is put to Dragon's Hoard instead of the Market Place after the Acquisition Roll.

#### ðŸƒ’-ðŸƒ™ Marauders

Each Player discards a card at random and puts it in to the Dragon's Hoard. However, if the number of cards in Player's Treasury is less than the face value of the Active Global Event card, the Player may ignore this effect.

All Resources in the Market Place with face value of more than or equal to the Active Global Event card receive a +2 modifier to their Target Value until end of Round.

#### * All Bets Are Off

If a Player rolls a 'Dabo!', the Player may trigger the Ultimate Power of the Character Card in the Global Event Zone and then exile it, provided there is one.

All Emblems can be targets of Acquisition Attempts by Active Player's on their Market Phase with a face value of 10 and the corresponding Resource Type. Buying Sequence takes place as normal, except all the Resources are placed into the Dragon's Hoard at the end of the Acquisition Attempt.
