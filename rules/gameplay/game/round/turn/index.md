# Turn Phase

Each Round the Players get to perform actions during the Turn Phase. The Players have one Active Turn when the Players declare their Market and Black Market actions, and multiple Passive Turns when they can react to other Players actions. Additionally, in between each Turn the Players can play Character Powers.

The Player executing the Turn Sequence is considered the Active Player. Subsequently, each other Player is considered a Passive Player.
