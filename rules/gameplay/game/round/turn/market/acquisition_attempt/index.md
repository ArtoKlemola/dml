# Acquisition Attempt

Dragon's Money Laundering is about acquiring goods. An Acquisition Attempt is declared, when an Active Player wants to buy certain Resources from the Marketplace, Emblems or goods from Black Markets.

Each Acquisition Attempt comprises of a Target Value and a dice roll. The Target Value is the minimum result the Player has to roll on two dice in order for the Acquisition Attempt to be successful.

The Target Value of an Acquisition Attempt is the combined face values of the Resources/Emblems selected by the Active Player. The Active Player has to roll equal to or more than the Target Value in order to obtain the desired Resources with the exception of 'Woot! Woot!' succeeding and 'Wyvern Eyes' failing automatically regardless of the Target Value. However, the Active Player and Passive Players have a chance to add negative and/or positive modifiers to the Target Value.

The Target Value can be modified in many ways. Events and bid Primary and Secondary Buying Resources alter the number the Player has to roll.

## Acquisition Attempt Sequence

1. Declaration Action
2. ( Seize Phase )
3. Bidding Action
4. Resolution Step

### Declaration Action

Active Player chooses any number of Resources from any one Stock in the Marketplace, or one Emblem another Player controls. The Player then places their selection in front of oneself.

The Target Value must be less than or equal to 12 at this point. During Declaration the Active Player may however bid any number of Primary Buying Resources to adjust the Target Value to equal 12 or less.

### Seize Phase

Every Acquisition Attempt towards Stocks on the Marketplace provoke opportunities for Seize Attempts. Seize Attempts are actions that Passive Players can declare against the declared Acquisition Attempt.

### Bidding Action

The Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt can be modified positively or negatively, thus making it easier or more difficult to roll on two dice.

The Active Player may bid any number of Primary Buying Resources from his/her Treasury to aid his/her chances to acquire the desired set of Resources, or to proceed with the Acquisition Attempt without modifying the Target Value
  * All Passive Players have a chance to declare a Seize Attempt against Active Player's Acquisition Attempt
    * If there are more than one Passive Player willing to declare a Seize Attempt, the Passive Player that wins a Face-to-Face Card-Off gets awarded the Seize Attempt to the current Acquisition Attempt

2. If the Active Player bid any Primary Buying Resources the Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt is decreased by the face values of the bid Resources. If not, the Target Value for the Acquisition Roll stays the same.
3. If a Passive Player has been awarded the Seize Attempt the Resources the Passive Player has bid increase the Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt by the face values of the particular Resources.
  * The Active Player has a chance to respond to any Seize Attempt bid by bidding more Primary Buying Resources or try to cancel out the Passive Player's Primary Buying Resources as defined by Counter-Bidding rule.
  * Similarly the Passive Player has a chance to bid more Primary Buying Resources in response to Active Player's bids
  * Bidding is repeated until no Player bids in response to another player's bid.
  * All modifiers are applied to the Target Value from the bid Resources.
4. The Active Player performs an Acquisition Roll against the Target Value
  * If the Active Player succeeds, the Active Player may put the set of Resources involved in the Acquisition Attempt in to the Active Player's Treasury
  * If the Active Player fails, the Passive Player may put the set of Resources involved in the Acquisition Attempt in to the Passive Player's Treasury
5. All bid Resources are put to the Market Place

### Resolution Step

The Active Player rolls 2D6. If the result is the same or higher as the Target Value, the Active Player puts the Resources or Emblems to one's own Treasury.

However, if the Active Player fails the roll, then any player who was awarded a Seize Attempt will get the Resources. If no Seize Attempts were made, and the roll still fails, the Resources or Emblems are put back to their origin Zone.

Any Primary or Secondary Buying Resources bid during the Acquisition Attempt are placed to the Marketplace in their respective Stocks.
