# Dice Roll

Dice rolling is used in two distinct sequences to settle the conditional nature of specific phases. The first time is during the Setup phase when deciding the starting controller of the Initiative Badge and it only happens once a game. Every other roll during the game is to determine whether an Acquisition Attempt is successful or not.

Dragon's Money Laundering rewards Players for rolling doubles, save rolling double ones. There are three categories of doubles and they all have different effects that trigger if they're rolled. The categories are: Dabo!, Woot! Woot!, and Wyvern Eyes.
