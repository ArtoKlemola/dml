## About the Master Rules Wiki

The Master Rules Wiki is the authoritative source of the latest Dragon's Money Laundering rules. In a sense, it's a living rulebook that gets ever better. It is used as the source to build each implementation of rules medium, be them web pages, man pages, books, and so on.

All the project related assets are also part of the repository and as such are subject to change. In Dragon's Money Laundering Master Rules Wiki nothing is set in stone.

### Structure

The Master Rules Wiki is divided into three logical main sections. Each of them are intertwined with each other on the project level, yet they are their own separate whole. They assist various developers to locate project artifacts relevant to their abilities without confusion.

The *[Assets](/assets/index)* section contain all artwork, music, screenplays and the like used throughout the project build processes and marketing. They are developed by volunteers willing to make Four Corners come to life and subsequently leave their own unique impression to it.

The *[Meta](/meta/index)* section is a collection of project-related meta data. This meta data usually doesn't fall into either of the other main sections: Assets or Rules. Most importantly the Meta section gives credit where credit is due.

The *[Rules](/rules/index)* section is naturally where the game itself resides.

### Contributing

The Master Rules Wiki and related assets are all developed by volunteers. No monetary compensation can be expected, or in fact even be considered at this point of development. All contributors whose assets are merged to the mother project  will however be awarded a visible position on Contributors page. For more information about contributing, copyright and licensing please refer to the project README.md or the Dragon's Money Laundering Developer's Wiki.
